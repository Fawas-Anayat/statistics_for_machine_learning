## Statistics Learning with Python

Welcome to my repository on Statistics Learning! 🎉
This repo contains Python codes, examples, and explanations that I’ve written while learning the concepts of statistics, probability, and their applications in data science and machine learning.

 ### What’s Inside?

Here you’ll find Python implementations of fundamental and advanced statistical topics such as:

📐 Basic Probability – Events, sample space, conditional probability

🧮 Bayes’ Theorem – With examples like email classification

🎲 Probability Distributions – Binomial, Normal, etc.

🗂 Naive Bayes Algorithm – From scratch and using libraries

📑 Worked Examples – Simple problems with detailed explanations


### 🎯 Goals of This Repository

-->To document my learning journey in statistics & probability
-->To make concepts easy and practical with Python code
-->To help beginners understand statistics for data science

### 🤝 Contributing

If you’re also learning statistics and want to add examples, feel free to fork this repo and submit a pull request.
